# STM32 Project Template

## 1. Introduction
System Workbench for STM32 - Bare Metal Edition is an Eclipse integrated IDE. It provides a software development platform for your 
STM32 board. The IDE helps you to quickly create a C embedded project for your target. It also integrates a complete code editor, 
compilation (compiler, assembler, linker...) tools and remote-debugging tools.

The following features are included in System Workbench for STM32 - Bare Metal Edition :
 - STM32 Devices database and libraries
 - Source code editor
 - Linker script generator
 - Building tools (GCC-based cross compiler, assembler, linker)
 - Debugging tools (OpenOCD, GDB)
 - Flash programing tools
 - Documentation	

System Workbench for STM32 is compatible with Eclipse extended features such as Subversive.
The IDE allows you to easily create a project and components for the device. To quickly build it and generate the ELF file, binary. 
To debug the project, System Workbench for STM32 provides a debug configuration to do the connection with ST-Link/V2 to debug on chip.
